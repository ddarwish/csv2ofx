Custom Mappings:

    csv2ofx gives preference to custom mappings over the built in mappings.
The builtin mappings (src/csv2ofx/mappings.py can be used as a template
for custom mappings.  You may copy the mappings.py file to your home
directory as csv2ofx_custom.py.  The file may also be placed in the current
working directory.  After creating a copy of the file, add or change the mappings
to suite your needs.  See mappings.py for mapping documentation.

Currently header must be  inserted to TCS csv file manually.
Header sample:
Value date;Writing date;Type;Status;nom;cnom;Amount;Currency;Category;Description

Enjoy!
